#**Lean, Agile  and all that...**

I am sure that at this moment this words are not anymore something unknow or new. But i feel day by day they lose their meaning.

I have seen teachers and consultants with no experience in an agile enviroment. Their expirence on the field is currently write books. They defend all the tools as they are a strict book to follow. I must say for my brain this is this is really crazy as per is imposible to learn something that is based on experience in a classroom.

How did we arrived to this point?, the reality is simple, money,if it can be sold it will be, and this names have become brands. It all started with SCRUM, it became at some point a keyword that all the people wanted to have on their CV. This made certifications started to apear. That continued expanding as a cancer and currently we even have belts for Lean. Is then Lean something that can be learned in a dojo? can it be mastered?.

The answer is as simple as a capital NO. Lean and Agile cannnot be mastered as it deppends on the team. I worked in a project during 5 years. Our practices where in continous evolution, as per the team also changed during time. During those 5 years I became the only stable piece of the puzzle. I saw managers, developers and testers changed, the same per each of this changes the project adapted to the team.

The project adapt to the team? shouldnt it be the oppositte?. Again capital NO!. The project is just a set of instructions that a machine will understand, the team is the living thigs that defines it. They will define how they want to work and interactuate.here is where all the practices that are part of agile come into play. The thing to take in count this should be like going to the supermarket, the team should cherry pick the tools they want to use.

In my First job experience i was amazed how in the office I used to work there where a set of 8 or 9 projects. From this projects at least 2 of us had good results. The most interesting thing was that our practices seemed to be completly opposite. When they used to do design workshops we where just doing constant code reviews. We used to do continuely mockups to show to clients they did their implementation directly. There where more differences but the thing is in both teams we fould our practices, this allowed us to be productive. Non of this 2 teams had anyone certified in any of the Agile practices, and we work correctly. 

Some other projects had people that had gone to expensive trainnigs to learn Scrum and they where certified. Their teams where using all the practices that existed and they learned in the trainings. This didnt bring a real improvement on the producitivity of those teams. Why? Just simple, practices are not * one size fits all*.

This is one thing that people that get a certification tend to forget quite easily. Not by pushing someone to use a tool will mean that this tool will make this person perform better. Most of the time is not an issue of training, is an issue of not fiting the team.

Having this in mind what are the diferent tools we can find and we can test in our teams to improve our productivity.
