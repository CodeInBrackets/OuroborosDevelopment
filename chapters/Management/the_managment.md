#**Lean, Agile  and all that nice words**

I am sure that at this moment this words are not anymore something unknow or new. But i feel day by day they lose their meaning.

I have seen teachers and consultants with no experience in an agile enviroment. Their expirence on the field is currently write books. They defend all the tools as they are a strict book to follow. I must say for my brain this is this is really crazy as per is imposible to learn something that is based on experience in a classroom.

How did we arrived to this point?, the reality is simple, money,if it can be sold it will be, and this names have become brands. It all started with SCRUM, it became at some point a keyword that all the people wanted to have on their CV. This made certifications started to apear. That continued expanding as a cancer and currently we even have belts for Lean. Is then Lean something that can be learned in a dojo? can it be mastered?.

The answer is as simple as a capital NO. Lean and Agile cannnot be mastered as it deppends on the team. I worked in a project during 5 years. Our practices where in continous evolution, as per the team also changed during time. During those 5 years I became the only stable piece of the puzzle. I saw managers, developers and testers changed, the same per each of this changes the project adapted to the team.

The project adapt to the team? shouldnt it be the oppositte?. Again capital NO!. The project is just a set of instructions that a machine will understand, the team is the living thigs that defines it. They will define how they want to work and interactuate.here is where all the practices that are part of agile come into play. The thing to take in count this should be like going to the supermarket, the team should cherry pick the tools they want to use.

In my First job experience i was amazed how in the office I used to work there where a set of 8 or 9 projects. From this projects at least 2 of us had good results. The most interesting thing was that our practices seemed to be completly opposite. When they used to do design workshops we where just doing constant code reviews.

There cant be anything worst happeining to a practice that wants to be mutable than getting a certification. As per it loses his flexibility.
Now there is a certification for absolutely everything. And certifications for sure is not what the definers and creators of all this where thinking about.
