#**The All Mighty Boards**

Lets start on the management tooling with one of the most extended practices: "THE BOARDS". 

This boards have probably a few different names, based on the methodology that you follow. The same as with the methodologies this becomes confising. Are really Kanban, Scrum Boards, etc, so different?. 

My general opinion yet again is that they are not so different and the thing that they differ in very small concepts. This small concepts are again things that we should meditate inside our teams to see if to use them or not.

Lets go step by step and analize the elements that we can use. This will allow you to know the must have and what you can actually cherrypick from for your purposes.
