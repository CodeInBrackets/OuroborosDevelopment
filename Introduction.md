#**First Baby Steps**

*you put a feet out of the house and you never nknow where that road will take you*

Some of you will recall this quote, some others wont. The attribution of it is for JRR Tolkien, and his famous Lord of the rings.This might sound out of place on a software books but during this years, I have come to realize that all are very similar. 

Wrtting a book and developing software have a lot of common things during their entire lifecicle. At the beginning we are flooded with ideas that make us unable to take a decition on what to focus on. When you finally manage to start you need to work hard for it put your fingers on the keyboard and let your imagination fly. The crisis of getting stuck will arrive you want it or not. And at the end your satisfaction will come by the enjoyment of others and not of yourself.

But what does it take to really do the entire development of your ideas that are still in an etherial form. What are the tools that we have to bring them to live. I am sure we all know the words Architecture, Code, Integracion, Requirements, and a long list of etceteras. But what are they for? are they of any use? are they all applayable?.

After the previous statement you might be thinking right now this is 'yet another book about startups'. Is not my intention there are really greats book related to that out on the market. I want to focus in what is expected from us now adays. We all hear about full stack development. This is just the tip of the iceberg full stack development is not half of what is expected today in companies from a developer. Every day more and more of us are pushed to other disciplines that not only involve coding.


#**Lean, Agile  and all that stuff**

I am sure that at this moment this words are not anymore something unknow or new.
