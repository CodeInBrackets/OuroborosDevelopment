#**First Baby Steps**

*It's a dangerous business, frodo, going out of your door.You step into the road, and if you dont keep your feet, there is no telling where you might be swept off to* 

Some of you will recall this quote, some others wont. The attribution is for JRR Tolkien, and his famous Lord of the rings book.This might sound out of place on a software books but during this years, I have come to realize that all are very similar. Stepping out to the unkown is one of the most scary and dificult things. 

Wrtting a book and developing software have a lot of common things during their entire lifecicle. At the beginning we are flooded with ideas that make us unable to take a decition on what to focus on. When you finally manage to start you need to work hard for it put your fingers on the keyboard and let your imagination fly. The crisis of getting stuck will arrive you want it or not. And at the end your satisfaction will come by the enjoyment of others and not of yourself.

But what does it take to really do the entire development of your ideas that are still in an etherial form. What are the tools that we have to bring them to live. I am sure we all know the words Architecture, Code, Integracion, Requirements, and a long list of etceteras. But what are they for? are they of any use? are they all applayable?.

After the previous statement you might be thinking right now this is 'yet another book about startups'. Is not my intention there are really greats book related to that out on the market. I want to focus in what is expected from us now adays. We all hear about full stack development. This is just the tip of the iceberg full stack development is not half of what is expected today in companies from a developer. Every day more and more of us are pushed to other disciplines that not only involve coding.


#**Lean, Agile  and all that nice words**

I am sure that at this moment this words are not anymore something unknow or new. But i feel day by day they lose their meaning.

I have seen teachers and consultants with no experience in an agile enviroment. Their expirence on the field is currently write books. They defend all the tools as they are a strict book to follow. I must say for my brain this is this is really crazy as per is imposible to learn something that is based on experience in a classroom.

How did we arrived to this point?, the reality is simple and is mark by the money that comes by a names that brands something. It all started with SCRUM, it bacame at some point a keyword that all the people wanted to have on their CV. This made certifications started to apear. Now we even have belts for Lean like if it could be learned in a dojo and there is something to master.

There cant be anything worst happeining to a practice that wants to be mutable than getting a certification. As per it loses his flexibility.
Now there is a certification for absolutely everything. And certifications for sure is not what the definers and creators of all this where thinking about.

Lean and Agile cannnot be mastered as it deppends on the team.
