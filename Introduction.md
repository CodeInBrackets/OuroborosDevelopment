#**First Baby Steps**

*you put a feet out of the house and you never nknow where that road will take you*

Some of you will recall this quote, some others wont. The attribution of it is for JRR Tolkien, and his famous Lord of the rings.This might sound out of place on a software books but during this years, I have come to realize that all are very similar. 

Wrtting a book and developing software have a lot of common things during their entire lifecicle. At the beginning we are flooded with ideas that make us unable to take a decition on what to focus on. When you finally manage to start you need to work hard for it put your fingers on the keyboard and let your imagination fly. The crisis of getting stuck will arrive you want it or not. And at the end your satisfaction will come by the enjoyment of others and not of yourself.
